# Thoughts 
I need to organize my thoughts. What is my S.M.A.R.T Goal here. 

- What are my ressources? 
Right now I have a lot of lazy workers. While I am sitting here, focused on all that stuff, they are actually doing nothing! So I need to find a task for them to do! And just let them already doing something already. And Rule #1 is first - do not loose money! 
Its approximately 5000 â‚¬ to invest. 

- What is your goal?
I want these workers to earn at least 10% of what they have until end of the year. **In one month, I want them to earn me 500 euros.**

- What is my strategy? 

I am going to research promising things to invest in. 
Which requirements does it need to fulfill? What are the steps I need to take? The iterations I have to make over and over? What is the reasoning for my investments? 
What mindset do I need to adapt what thought patterns are great investors adapting? 
What makes up their decisions?
